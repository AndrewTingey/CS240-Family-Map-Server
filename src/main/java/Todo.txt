    -I followed "Sharing Code Between an Intellij Server Project and an Android Studio Client Project" at https://docs.google.com/document/d/14MlUzkUtiCMudym8N4ZclRY9e8ea4KdhIdTgAT293r4/edit?usp=sharing
    first try, I named module "FMSCommunication" and got error, "output path is not specified for "FMSCommunication""
    this resulted in no out/artifacts, so I deleted any files that were created and restarted with module "shared"
    after building artifacts for shared, there popped up out/artifacts/FMSCommunication_jar
    and then i dragged and dropped FMSComunication.jar, instead of copy/pasting it (<- correctly mispelled as such)
